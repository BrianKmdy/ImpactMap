17,"1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA","In order to reduce energy consumption and the stateÂ’s carbon footprint, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has called for a 60Â–80% reduction in lighting energy consumption by 2020. Answering this call, UC Davis established the Smart Lighting Initiative (SLI), an effort to reduce campus-wide lighting electricity consumption at least 60% below 2007 levels. The first phase of this program included a large-scale deployment of over 1,500 network-controlled LED streetlights, area lights, post-tops, and wall packs.\
This business case explores various lighting control options for LED retrofits of street and area lighting, along with funding and financing sources. It provides a general economic analysis of the costs and benefits associated with street/area retrofits and new-construction installations of post-top luminaires. The scenarios presented in this business case analysis have the potential to reduce lighting energy use and carbon emissions 72Â–93%, in areas with an avera",\N,\N,37.53987,-125.752244,\N,"Campus-wide Networked Adaptive LED Lighting, UC Davis",\N,"CLTC",\N,\N

The scenarios presented in this business case analysis have the potential to reduce lighting energy use and carbon emissions 72Â–93%, in areas with an average occupancy rate of 20%. In June 2012, UC Davis completed a campus-wide exterior lighting retrofit using fixture-level occupancy sensors by WattStopper and an RF mesh network lighting control system by Lumewave. Over 1500 new dimmable LED fixtures by Philips were installed as part of the project. Parking lot and roadway lighting, wall packs, and post-top fixtures are now incorporated into a single smart lighting system that senses occupantsÂ’ direction and rate of travel and adjusts light levels for the route while",\N,\N,38.53987,-121.752244,\N,"SPEED Business Case: Adaptive Street and Area Lighting",\N,"CLTC",\N,\N

20,"1 Shields Avenue, Davis, CA","To maximize the respective benefits of open-loop and closed-loop systems, and minimize their limitations, the California Lighting Technology Center (CLTC) developed a dual-loop photosensor control system for skylight applications. The system features a control algorithm that monitors the open-loop and closed-loop photosensors and controls the electric light to provide the designed light level. It also automatically recalibrates nightly in order to adjust to longterm changes to the interior space.",\N,\N,38.53987,-122.752244,\N,"Dual-loop Photosensor Control System for Daylight Harvesting",\N,"CLTC",\N,\N
